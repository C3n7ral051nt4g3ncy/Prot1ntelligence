### ALPHA 🔍
``` 
The Alpha Module confirms if a ProtonMail email address exists and is VALID.
It also works for custom domains and "catch all" email addresses.
```
### BRAVO 📡
``` 
The Bravo Module is a logical follow to Module ALPHA, you confirmed that the email address of the target is VALID.
Now you can use BRAVO to check for Digital Footprints of the target on open source websites,
simply by running a search with the target email using quotation marks as a DORK to get an exact match.
```
### CHARLIE 🏴
``` 
The Charlie Module runs a search on the dark web Target Digital Footprints
``` 
### DELTA 🔑
``` 
The Delta Module finds information on the ProtonMail user PGP Key, Key creation date and Encryption standard.
If we are sure the target didn't generate a new PGP Key, the date is also the ProtonMail account creation date.
You can also request the download of the PGP Key, and add it to your KeyChain to send an encrypted email to the target. 
```  
### ECHO 💻
``` 
The Echo Module confirms if the IP address you have for the target is an IP address belonging to ProtonVPN 
```

 # Support 💗
This tool took me a good few weeks to make, if you like it and it's useful for you, please feel free to make a donation for my work by clicking on the **KO-FI** Badge or the **BITCOIN** Badge at the top of this readme file, simply scan the BTC QR Code to get my BTC Address. 
  
  
# Mention 
The tool has 3 modules based on Protosint made by **Pixelbubble**.
As Protosint does not work for a module, and is missing some search modules, that is why I decided to make something different for my first project but some code and ideas was forked from:
https://github.com/pixelbubble/ProtOSINT
