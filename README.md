# PROTINTELLIGENCE üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
**ProtINTelligence** is a Python üêç script for the **OSINT &amp; Cyber Community**.<br>
You will be able to get intelligence on:
- ProtonMail accounts/users
- ProtonVPN users IP adresses
- ProtonMail PGP Key of users
- Digital Footprints left by the ProtonMail user on the clear and Dark Web.

# v2.0 using NeutrOSINT
It was created on 23/11/2022 and the fix was made by [@Kr0wZ](https://github.com/Kr0wZ) by using his own script called [NeutrOSINT](https://github.com/Kr0wZ/NeutrOSINT), which uses the selenium module to check if an email is valid.
<br>

  
# Requirements üêç

### ALPHA üîç
``` 
The Alpha Module confirms if a ProtonMail email address exists and is VALID.
It also works for custom domains and "catch all" email addresses.
```
### BRAVO üì°
``` 
The Bravo Module is a logical follow to Module ALPHA, you confirmed that the email address of the target is VALID.
Now you can use BRAVO to check for Digital Footprints on open source websites,
simply by running a search with the target email using quotation marks as a DORK to get an exact match.
```
### CHARLIE üè¥
``` 
The Charlie Module runs a search on the dark web to check the target email digital footprints
``` 
### DELTA üîë
``` 
The Delta Module gets information on the ProtonMail user PGP Key, Key creation date and Encryption standard.
If we are sure the target didn't generate a new PGP Key, the date is also the ProtonMail account creation date.
You can also request the download of the PGP Key, and add it to your KeyChain to send an encrypted email to the user. 
```  
### ECHO üíª
``` 
The Echo Module confirms if the IP address you have for the target is an IP address belonging to a ProtonVPN user.
```

The code used is from Kr0wZ's own code from [NeutrOSINT](https://github.com/Kr0wZ/NeutrOSINT)
  
Thanks to [Joe Gray](https://twitter.com/C_3PJoe) for his great courses and the knowledge he passed on to me.
  
Thanks to [White Hat Inspector](https://twitter.com/WHInspector) and [Justin Seitz](https://twitter.com/jms_dot_py) for their OSINT Automation with Python knowledge sharing, and thanks to [devnode777](https://github.com/devnode777) for 2 changes.

 # Support üíó
This tool took me a good few weeks to make, if you like it and if it's useful for you, please feel free to make a donation for my work by clicking on the **KO-FI** Badge or the **BITCOIN** Badge at the top of this .README file, or simply scan the BTC QR Code to get my BTC Address. 
  
  
# Mention üì¢
The tool has 3 modules based on **PROTOSINT** made by **@Pixelbubble**.
As Protosint did not work correctly for me and is missing some search modules that I wanted, I decided to make something different for my first project, but a little bit of code and ideas was forked from:
https://github.com/pixelbubble/ProtOSINT
